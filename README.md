# vue-animate-onelscroll
A simple Vue directive that animates elements as they scroll into view.

## Installation

```sh
npm install vue-animate-onelscroll
# or
yarn add vue-animate-onelscroll
```

## Setup
Import to your `Vue` application
```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueAnimateOnElScroll from 'vue-animate-onelscroll'

Vue.use(VueAnimateOnElScroll)
```

## Usage
For demo purposes, let's use [animate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/),
a css animation library but using your own custom CSS animations would work the same way as well.

Import `animate.css` anyway you like. For demo purposes, in your `index.html`
```html
<head>
  <!-- some other stuff -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/animate.css@3.5.2/animate.min.css">
</head>
```

Pass the desired class as a string literal (in single quotes) in your `Vue` template:
```html
<div v-onelscroll="'animated flip'">Animate me once upon scroll</div>
```

### Repeat Modifier
Note that by default the animation will only trigger once: the first time the element scrolled into view. If you want to repeat the animation everytime it was scrolled into view, use the `repeat` modifier:
```html
<div v-onelscroll.repeat="'animated flip'">Animate me upon scroll forever</div>
```

### Scroll Direction
It's also possible to animate only on a specific scroll direction by passing in an object as the value. In the following example, the animation will only trigger the first time you scroll down on the element.

```html
<div v-onelscroll="{down: 'animated flip'}">Animate me once upon scroll down</div>
```
On upward scroll:
```html
<div v-onelscroll="{up: 'animated rotateOut'}">Animate me once upon scroll up</div>
```

If you want to repeat the animation *everytime you scroll down* to the element add the `repeat` modifier:

```html
<div v-onelscroll.repeat="{down: 'animated flip'}">Animate me everytime you scroll down on me</div>
```

### Multiple animations
Or use two different animations for each scroll direction:
```html
<div v-onelscroll="{down: 'animated flip', up: 'animated rotateOut' }">Animate me upon scroll forever</div>
```
Note that by providing both `up` and `down` directions, the `repeat` modifier is implicitly in effect.
